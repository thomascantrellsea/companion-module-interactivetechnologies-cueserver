# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- Use CommonJS modules (`require`/`module.exports`) to stay consistent with the existing codebase.
- Keep tests in the `__tests__/` directory and use Jest as the unit test framework.
- Prefer clear, direct assertions over snapshot tests.
- When updating `package.json`, keep the script list alphabetized and avoid removing existing scripts unless required.
